- add support for esp-alloc showing free/used (when making into a library consider a feature)

- make it into a library + example
- expand to other chips (maybe don't support CPU-utilization for Xtensa, but we could)

- are there escape codes to hide and restore the cursor (i.e. not hide and show)? if not just hide + show
